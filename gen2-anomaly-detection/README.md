# Anomaly Detection

The goal of anomaly detection is to recognize examples of an object that may fall out of a desired distribution of acceptable objects. For example, in manufacturing, we may want to automaticaly detect when some defect occurs.

This experiment uses a [PaDiM model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08785.pdf) trained on wood. Training was done using the [anomalib](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib) library.
