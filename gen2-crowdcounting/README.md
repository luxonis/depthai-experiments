## [Gen2] Crowd Counting with density maps on DepthAI

This example shows an implementation of Crowd Counting with density maps on DepthAI in the Gen2 API system.  We use [DM-Count](https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/DM-Count) ([LICENSE](https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/DM-Count/blob/master/LICENSE)) model, which has a VGG-19 backbone and is trained on Shanghai B data set.

The model produces density map from which predicted count can be computed.

Input video is resized to 426 x 240 (W x H). Due to a relatively heavy model, the inference speed is around 1 FPS.
