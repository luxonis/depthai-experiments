# Lossless Zooming

This demo shows how you can achieve lossless zooming on the device. Demo will zoom into the first face it detects. It will crop 4K frames into 1080P, centered around the face. Demo uses [face-detection-retail-0004](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/omz_models_model_face_detection_retail_0004.html) NN model.

## Demo

### MJPEG

You can turn `MJPEG` on or off. It's set to `True` by default, so cropped 1080P stream will get encoded into MJPEG on the device. On the host, it will just get decoded and shown to the user, but you could also save the MJPEG stream or stream it elsewhere.


## Installation
