# Mask R-CNN on DepthAI

This example shows how to run a Mask R-CNN model on DepthAI. Please note that since it is a heavier model so the expected speed is ~ 2-4 FPS

## Export
You can export your Mask R-CNN directly to OpenVINO IR and then to blob. For the first conversion you can use [this repository](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_contrib/tree/master/modules/mo_pytorch), where you would select `torchvision.models.detection.mask_rcnn.maskrcnn_resnet50_fpn` model and load your weights. More instruction can be found in the repository. After obtaining XML and BIN you can use [blobconverter](https://blobconverter.luxonis.com/) to convert them to blob and use them on OAK.

## Pre-requisites

Install requirements:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```
python3 main.py [options]
```

Options:

* `-t` or `--threshold`: Threshold for filtering out detections with lower probability. Default **0.5**.
* `-rt` or `--region_threshold`: Threshold for filtering out mask points with low probability. Default: **0.5**.
