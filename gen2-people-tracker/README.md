# Gen2 People tracker

This application counts how many people went upwards / downwards / leftwards / rightwards in the video stream, allowing you to
receive an information about how many people went into a room or went through a corridor.

This demo can also send tracklets results through the SPI.

The model used in this example is [person_detection_retail_0013](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/omz_models_intel_person_detection_retail_0013_description_person_detection_retail_0013.html) from the OpenVINO Model Zoo.
