## RGB-D projection Demo

This example shows how to align depth to rgb camera frame and project depth map into 3D pointcloud. You can also choose to skip rgb-depth alignment and colorize the pointcloud with right mono frame.

## Install project requirements

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: Running the command above also tries to install open3D which is required for this example.
open3D is not supported by all platforms, but is required for pointcloud visualization.

## Run this example

```
python3 main.py
```
