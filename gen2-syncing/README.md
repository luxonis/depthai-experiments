# Message syncing

These examples show how to synchronize incoming messages. You can soft-synchronize messages either by sequence number or timestamp.
All devices continuously sync their timestamps with the host (under the hood), so to sync frames across multiple devices you
would use timestamp.

**For Hardware syncing** (STROBE/FSIN), see [docs here](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/guides/sync_frames.html).

When to use **sequence number for syncing**:
- You have only one OAK camera, and want to **sync frames and/or NN results**
- Easier for comparing than timestamp

When to use **timestamp for syncing**:
- When you have **multiple OAK cameras** connected to the same host
- When you also want to sync IMU data. IMU data only has timestamp assigned.

## Host sync frame with NN result

Sync frames with NN inference results on the host. In this example we have used sequence number to sync messages. Frames always arrive to the host sooner than NN results (as inference time takes ~100ms), so we just save all frames in an array, and when a new NN result arrives, we find the correct frame from sequence number and use that to draw detections on.

`python3 host-nn-sync.py`

## Device sync frame with NN result

This approach is very similar to the host sync-nn-sync, but we sync frames with NN results on the device, more specifically in the Script node. Once we have a synced NN result-Frame pair, we send both of these messages to the host where they are shown to the user.

`python3 device-nn-sync.py`

## Host frame sync

This example demonstrates how to  frames using their sequence numbers, from all 3 on-device cameras.
This allows displaying frames taken in exact same moment. For a better visualization, all 3 streams are horizontally stacked:
left + rgb + right.

## Host rgb-depth sync

[host-rgb-depth-sync.py](host-rgb-depth-sync.py) demo is a version of [RGB-Depth alignment example](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/samples/StereoDepth/rgb_depth_aligned/#rgb-depth-alignment).

It uses sequence number to sync rgb-aligned depth and rgb frames on the host, and displays depth overlay on rgb frame.

## IMU + rgb + depth timestamp syncing

Very similar to the above [Host rgb-depth sync](#host-rgb-depth-sync), the [imu-frames-timestamp-sync.py](imu-frames-timestamp-sync.py) demo uses **timestamps to sync IMU results with rgb and depth frames**. It also displays depth overlay on rgb frame.

In case of **multiple streams having different FPS**, there are **2 options on how to sync** them:

1. **Removing some messages** from faster streams to get the synced FPS of the slower stream
2. **Duplicating some messages** from slower streams to get the synced FPS of the fastest stream

This demo uses the 1st approach. Time difference between synced messages is below 22ms, `MS_THRESHOLD` * 2. We achieve 30FPS, which is the FPS of the slowest stream (rgb frames).

## Sync multiple OAK cameras

If you would like to sync multiple streams (color/left/right) across multiple devices, you should
`python3 host-multiple-OAK-sync.py` script. It uses timestamps to sync frames.

Since timestamp is synced with the host, all OAK cameras get the same timestamp thus timestamps are in the script to sync across multiple devices.

![demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18037362/130965049-0d315888-1ff4-4455-b5ec-668d33e6f051.png)

As you can see, bottom color image is 16ms behind other frames. Since we were using 30FPS, time difference below 16.6 are considered in sync
(`1/FPS => 33.3ms/2 => 16.6`).

## More complex NN result syncing

If you would like to do a more complex syncing of frames and (multiple) NN results, like 2-stage inference, see [example here](../gen2-age-gender/). There's a file `MultiMsgSync.py`, which will sync frames with object detections and object recognition NN results.
