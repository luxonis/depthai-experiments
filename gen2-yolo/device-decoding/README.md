# Yolo detection with on-device decoding

![Yolo-on-device](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56075061/144863222-a52be87e-b1f0-4a0a-b39b-f865bbb6e4a4.png)

This repository contains the code for running Yolo object detection with on-device decoding with DepthAI SDK (`main.py`)  or DepthAI API (`main_api.py`) directly. Currently, the supported versions are:

* YoloV3 & YoloV3-tiny,
* YoloV4 & YoloV4-tiny,
* YoloV5.

We use the same style of JSON parsing in `main.py` and in `main_api.py`, but you can also set the values in both cases manually in the code.

### Export your model

As the models have to be exported to OpenVINO IR in a certain way, we provide the tutorials on training and exporting:

* Yolo**V3**, Yolo**V4**, and their **tiny** versions: *YoloV3_V4_tiny_training.ipynb* [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/luxonis/depthai-ml-training/blob/master/colab-notebooks/YoloV3_V4_tiny_training.ipynb),

* Yolo**V5**: *YoloV5_training.ipynb* [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/luxonis/depthai-ml-training/blob/master/colab-notebooks/YoloV5_training.ipynb).

## Usage

1. Install requirements
	```python
	python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
2. Run the script
    ```
    python3 main.py -m <model_name> -c <config_json>
    ```
    or
    ```
    python3 main_api.py -m <model_name> -c <config_json>
    ```
    where:

    * `<model_name>` is the **name of the model** from DepthAI model zoo (https://zoo.luxonis.com) or **relative path to the blob** file. Please check our model zoo to see which pre-trained models are available.
    * `<config_json>` is the **relative path** to the JSON with metadata (input shape, anchors, labels, ...) of the Yolo model.

## JSONs

We already provide some JSONs for common Yolo versions. You can edit them and set them up for your model, as described in the **next steps** section in the mentioned tutorials. In case you are changing some of the parameters in the tutorial, you should edit the corresponding parameters. In general, the settings in the JSON should follow the settings in the CFG of the model. For YoloV5, the default settings should be the same as for YoloV3.

**Note**: Values must match the values set in the CFG during training. If you use a different input width, you should also change `side32` to `sideX` and `side16` to `sideY`, where `X = width/16` and `Y = width/32`. If you are using a non-tiny model, those values are `width/8`, `width/16`, and `width/32`.

You can also change IOU and confidence thresholds. Increase the IOU threshold if the same object is getting detected multiple times. Decrease confidence threshold if not enough objects are detected. Note that this will not magically improve your object detector, but might help if some objects are filtered out due to the threshold being too high.

## Depth information

DepthAI enables you to take the advantage of depth information and get `x`, `y`, and `z` coordinates of detected objects. Experiments in this directory are not using the depth information. If you are interested in using the depth information with Yolo detectors, please check our [documentation](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/samples/SpatialDetection/spatial_tiny_yolo/#rgb-tinyyolo-with-spatial-data).
