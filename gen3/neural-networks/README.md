# Overview
This section provides experiments to help you get started with **AI model inference** using **DepthAI**.
They utilize publicly available models from the [HubAI Model ZOO](https://hub.luxonis.com/ai/models).
The experiments can be ran on a Luxonis device of choice and make inference either on it's sensory output or media files of interest (image or video). 
The inference results are displayed in the browser.

The experiments are organized into two categories:
- [Basic experiment](basic-experiment/): Generic pipeline for making inference using single models with a single-image input;
- [Advanced experiments](advanced-experiment/): Custom single- or multiple-model pipelines, with input that can be a single image, multiple images, or other data.

Below we list all of the available **Gen3 experiments** (together with their **Gen2 counterparts**).
