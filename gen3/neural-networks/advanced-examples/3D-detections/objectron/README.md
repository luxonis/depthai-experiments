# Gen2 Objectron

[Objectron](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/objectron.html) performs 3D object detection. It predicts the keypoints of a 3D bounding box around an object in the image plane!

We use the two-stage architecture, so it is specialized for certain classes. This demo uses the chair model. However, other models pretrained by Mediapipe include bikes, books, bottles, cameras, cereal boxes, chairs, cups, laptops, and shoes.
