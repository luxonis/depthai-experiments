# Overview

This experiment demonstrates how to build a DepthAI pipeline for crowd counting.
We use [DM-Count](https://hub.luxonis.com/ai/models/16d01eab-dc2b-4422-907d-2634a940b52e?view=page) model to produce a crowd density map from which the count is computed.

## Installation

Running this example requires a **Luxonis OAK device** connected to your computer. You can find more information about the supported devices and the set up instructions in our [Documentation](https://rvc4.docs.luxonis.com/hardware).
Moreover, you need to prepare a **Python 3.10** environment with [DepthAI](https://pypi.org/project/depthai/) and [DepthAI Nodes](https://pypi.org/project/depthai-nodes/) packages installed. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can run the experiment fully on device (`STANDALONE` mode) or using your your computer as host (`PERIPHERAL` mode).

Here is a list of all available parameters:

```
-m MODEL, --model MODEL
                    Crowd counting model HubAI reference. (default: luxonis/dm-count:shb-426x240)
-d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                    Optional name, DeviceID or IP of the camera to connect to. (default: None)
-fps FPS_LIMIT, --fps_limit FPS_LIMIT
                    FPS limit for the model runtime. (default: 1 for RVC2 and 5 for RVC4)
-media MEDIA_PATH, --media_path MEDIA_PATH
                    Path to the media file you aim to run the model on. If not set, the model will run on the camera input. (default: None)
```

### Peripheral Mode

Running in peripheral mode requires a host computer and there will be communication between device and host which could affect the overall speed of the app. Below are some examples of how to run the example.

#### Examples

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This will run the experiment with default arguments.

### Standalone Mode

Running the experiment in the [Standalone mode](https://rvc4.docs.luxonis.com/software/depthai/standalone/) runs the app entirely on the device.
To run the example in this mode, first install the [oakctl](https://rvc4.docs.luxonis.com/software/tools/oakctl/) command-line tool (enables host-device interaction) as:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://oakctl-releases.luxonis.com/oakctl-installer.sh)"
```

The app can then be run with:

```bash
oakctl connect <DEVICE_IP>
oakctl app run .
```

This will run the experiment with default argument values. If you want to change these values you need to edit the `oakapp.toml` file.
