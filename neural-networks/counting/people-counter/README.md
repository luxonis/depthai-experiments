# People Counter

This experiments demonstrate how to count people in the frame. It uses [SCRFD Person detection](https://zoo-rvc4.luxonis.com/luxonis/scrfd-person-detection/c3830468-3178-4de6-bc09-0543bbe28b1c) model.

## Usage

Running this example requires a **Luxonis device** connected to your computer. Refer to the [documentation](https://stg.docs.luxonis.com/software-v3/) to setup your device if you haven't done it already.

You can run the experiment fully on device ([`STANDALONE` mode](#standalone-mode-rvc4-only)) or using your computer as host ([`PERIPHERAL` mode](#peripheral-mode)).

Here is a list of all available parameters:

```
-m MODEL, --model MODEL
                    Crowd counting model HubAI reference. (default: luxonis/scrfd-person-detection:25g-640x640)
-d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                    Optional name, DeviceID or IP of the camera to connect to. (default: None)
-fps FPS_LIMIT, --fps_limit FPS_LIMIT
                    FPS limit for the model runtime. (default: 10 for RVC2 and 30 for RVC4)
-media MEDIA_PATH, --media_path MEDIA_PATH
                    Path to the media file you aim to run the model on. If not set, the model will run on the camera input. (default: None)
```

> **Note:** This example currently only works on RVC2 devices becuase dai.ObjectTracker node is not supported on RVC4.

## Peripheral Mode

### Installation

You need to first prepare a **Python 3.10** environment with the following packages installed:

- [DepthAI](https://pypi.org/project/depthai/),
- [DepthAI Nodes](https://pypi.org/project/depthai-nodes/).

You can simply install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running in peripheral mode requires a host computer and there will be communication between device and host which could affect the overall speed of the app. Below are some examples of how to run the example.

### Examples

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This will run the experiment with default arguments.

```bash
python3 main.py -d <DEVICE_IP>
```

This will run the people counter experiment with the provided device ip, camera input and default fps limit based on the device.

## Standalone Mode (RVC4 only)

Running the example in the standalone mode, app runs entirely on the device.
To run the example in this mode, first install the `oakctl` tool using the installation instructions [here](https://stg.docs.luxonis.com/software-v3/oak-apps/oakctl).

The app can then be run with:

```bash
oakctl connect <DEVICE_IP>
oakctl app run .
```

This will run the experiment with default argument values. If you want to change these values you need to edit the `oakapp.toml` file (refer [here](https://stg.docs.luxonis.com/software-v3/oak-apps/configuration/) for more information about this configuration file).
