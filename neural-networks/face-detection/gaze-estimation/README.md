# Gaze Estimation

This example demonstrates how to run a 3 stage pipeline and multi input models. A gaze estimation example is built to showcase the 3 stage pipeline. The pipeline is composed of the following three models:

1. [SCRFD face detection model](https://zoo-rvc4.luxonis.com/luxonis/scrfd-face-detection/1f3d7546-66e4-43a8-8724-2fa27df1096f) is used to detect the faces and their keypoints. Based on this models outputs, the entire face and the eyes are cropped from the original frame.
1. The cropped face is used as input to the [Head pose model](https://zoo-rvc4.luxonis.com/luxonis/head-pose-estimation/068ac18a-de71-4a6e-9f0f-42776c0ef980) which returns the 3D vector the heads position.
1. The cropped eyes and the 3D pose vector are fed into [ADAS gaze estimation model](https://zoo-rvc4.luxonis.com/luxonis/gaze-estimation-adas/b174ff1b-740b-4016-b8d5-b9488dbdd657) to compute the final gaze of the person.

**:exclamation: ON RVC2 you can run the example with camera input only (`--media` flag doesnt work due to a problem with the replay node). :exclamation:**

## Usage

Running this example requires a **Luxonis device** connected to your computer. Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.luxonis.com/software-v3/) to setup your device if you haven't done it already.

You can run the example fully on device ([`STANDALONE` mode](#standalone-mode-rvc4-only)) or using your computer as host ([`PERIPHERAL` mode](#peripheral-mode)).

Here is a list of all available parameters:

```
-d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                      Optional name, DeviceID or IP of the camera to connect to. (default: None)
-fps FPS_LIMIT, --fps_limit FPS_LIMIT
                      FPS limit for the model runtime. (default: 8 for RVC2 and 30 for RVC4)
-media MEDIA_PATH, --media_path MEDIA_PATH
                      Path to the media file you aim to run the model on. If not set, the model will run on the camera input. (default: None)
```

## Peripheral Mode

### Installation

You need to first prepare a **Python 3.10** environment with the following packages installed:

- [DepthAI](https://pypi.org/project/depthai/),
- [DepthAI Nodes](https://pypi.org/project/depthai-nodes/).

You can simply install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running in peripheral mode requires a host computer and there will be communication between device and host which could affect the overall speed of the app. Below are some examples of how to run the example.

### Examples

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This will run the example with default arguments.

## Standalone Mode (RVC4 only)

Running the example in the standalone mode, app runs entirely on the device.
To run the example in this mode, first install the `oakctl` tool using the installation instructions [here](https://docs.luxonis.com/software-v3/oak-apps/oakctl).

The app can then be run with:

```bash
oakctl connect <DEVICE_IP>
oakctl app run .
```

This will run the experiment with default argument values. If you want to change these values you need to edit the `oakapp.toml` file (refer [here](https://docs.luxonis.com/software-v3/oak-apps/configuration/) for more information about this configuration file).
