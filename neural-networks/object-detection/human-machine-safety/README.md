# Human-Machine safety

This example demonstrates how to detect dangerous objects and calculates distance to a human hand (palm). In our case the dangerous objects are cups and bottles. The experiment uses 2 detection models: [YOLOv6 Nano](https://hub.luxonis.com/ai/models/face58c4-45ab-42a0-bafc-19f9fee8a034?view=page) for dangerous objects detection and [MediaPipe Palm Detection](https://hub.luxonis.com/ai/models/9531aba9-ef45-4ad3-ae03-808387d61bf3?view=page) for palm detection. It also uses depth information from our OAK cameras and combines that information with the detections to get the spatial coordinates of the objects and the palm. This way we can calculate the distance between the detected objects and the palm and warn the user if the distance is too close.

## Installation

You need to prepare a Python environment with [DepthAI](https://pypi.org/project/depthai/) and [DepthAI Nodes](https://pypi.org/project/depthai-nodes/) packages installed. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can run the experiment fully on device (`STANDALONE` mode) or using your your computer as host (`PERIPHERAL` mode).

Here is a list of all available parameters:

```
-d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                    Optional name, DeviceID or IP of the camera to connect to. (default: None)
```

### Peripheral Mode

Running in peripheral mode requires a host computer and there will be communication between device and host which could affect the overall speed of the app. Below are some examples of how to run the example.

#### Examples

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This will run the human-machine safety experiment with the default device.

### Standalone Mode

Running the experiment in the [Standalone mode](https://rvc4.docs.luxonis.com/software/depthai/standalone/) runs the app entirely on the device.
To run the example in this mode, first install the [oakctl](https://rvc4.docs.luxonis.com/software/tools/oakctl/) command-line tool (enables host-device interaction) as:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://oakctl-releases.luxonis.com/oakctl-installer.sh)"
```

The app can then be run with:

```bash
oakctl connect <DEVICE_IP>
oakctl app run .
```

This will run the experiment with default argument values. If you want to change these values you need to edit the `oakapp.toml` file.
