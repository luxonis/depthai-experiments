# Social Distancing

This experiment demonstates how we can use DepthAI to monitor social distancing. It uses our depth-enabled OAK camera and on-device AI processing. For detecting people we use [SCRFD Person detection model](https://zoo-rvc4.luxonis.com/luxonis/scrfd-person-detection/c3830468-3178-4de6-bc09-0543bbe28b1c) from HubAI. We merge the detections with depth information to get the 3D position of each person. We then calculate the distance between each pair of people and if the distance is less than a threshold, we display a warning.

Below you can see 3 people in a scene. If they get closer than the threshold of 2 meters, the application will display `Too Close` and the distance between them.

> **Note:** This example requires a device with at least 3 cameras (color, left and right) since it utilizes the `StereoDepth` node.

## Usage

Running this example requires a **Luxonis device** connected to your computer. Refer to the [documentation](https://stg.docs.luxonis.com/software/) to setup your device if you haven't done it already.

You can run the experiment fully on device ([`STANDALONE` mode](#standalone-mode-rvc4-only)) or using your your computer as host ([`PERIPHERAL` mode](#peripheral-mode)).

Here is a list of all available parameters:

```
-d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                      Optional name, DeviceID or IP of the camera to connect to. (default: None)
-fps FPS_LIMIT, --fps_limit FPS_LIMIT
                      FPS limit for the model runtime. (default: 10 for both RVC2 and RVC4)
```

## Peripheral Mode

### Installation

You need to first prepare a **Python 3.10** environment with the following packages installed:

- [DepthAI](https://pypi.org/project/depthai/),
- [DepthAI Nodes](https://pypi.org/project/depthai-nodes/).

You can simply install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running in peripheral mode requires a host computer and there will be communication between device and host which could affect the overall speed of the app. Below are some examples of how to run the example.

### Examples

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This will run the experiment with default arguments.

## Standalone Mode (RVC4 only)

Running the example in the standalone mode, app runs entirely on the device.
To run the example in this mode, first install the `oakctl` tool using the installation instructions [here](https://stg.docs.luxonis.com/software/oak-apps/oakctl).

The app can then be run with:

```bash
oakctl connect <DEVICE_IP>
oakctl app run .
```

This will run the experiment with default argument values. If you want to change these values you need to edit the `oakapp.toml` file (refer [here](https://stg.docs.luxonis.com/software/oak-apps/configuration/) for more information about this configuration file).
