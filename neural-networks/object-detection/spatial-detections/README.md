# Spatial Detections

This experiment shows how to use DepthAI and OAK camera to detect object with their spatial coordinates in real-time! The experiment by default uses [YOLOv6 Nano](https://zoo-rvc4.luxonis.com/luxonis/yolov6-nano/face58c4-45ab-42a0-bafc-19f9fee8a034) object detection model but you can use other models as well by using `-m` or `--model` argument. It should work with any YOLO detection model.

You can read more about spatial detection network in our [documentation](https://docs.luxonis.com/software/depthai-components/nodes/yolo_spatial_detection_network/). It combines the bounding boxes with the depth information into spatial image detections.

> **Note:** This example requires a device with at least 3 cameras (color, left and right) since it utilizes the `StereoDepth` node.

## Usage

Running this example requires a **Luxonis device** connected to your computer. Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.luxonis.com/software-v3/) to setup your device if you haven't done it already.

You can run the experiment fully on device ([`STANDALONE` mode](#standalone-mode-rvc4-only)) or using your computer as host ([`PERIPHERAL` mode](#peripheral-mode)).

Here is a list of all available parameters:

```
-m MODEL, --model MODEL
                    Model reference to use for object detection. (default: luxonis/yolov6-nano:r2-coco-512x288)
-d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                    Optional name, DeviceID or IP of the camera to connect to. (default: None)
-fps FPS_LIMIT, --fps_limit FPS_LIMIT
                    FPS limit for the model runtime. (default: 20 for RVC2 and 30 for RVC4)
```

## Peripheral Mode

### Installation

You need to first prepare a **Python 3.10** environment with the following packages installed:

- [DepthAI](https://pypi.org/project/depthai/),
- [DepthAI Nodes](https://pypi.org/project/depthai-nodes/).

You can simply install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running in peripheral mode requires a host computer and there will be communication between device and host which could affect the overall speed of the app. Below are some examples of how to run the example.

### Examples

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This will run the experiment with the default YOLOv6-Nano model.

```bash
python3 main.py --model luxonis/yolov6-large:r2-coco-640x352
```

This will run the experiment with the specified YOLOv6-Large model.

## Standalone Mode (RVC4 only)

Running the example in the standalone mode, app runs entirely on the device.
To run the example in this mode, first install the `oakctl` tool using the installation instructions [here](https://docs.luxonis.com/software-v3/oak-apps/oakctl).

The app can then be run with:

```bash
oakctl connect <DEVICE_IP>
oakctl app run .
```

This will run the experiment with default argument values. If you want to change these values you need to edit the `oakapp.toml` file (refer [here](https://docs.luxonis.com/software-v3/oak-apps/configuration/) for more information about this configuration file).
