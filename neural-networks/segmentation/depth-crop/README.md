# Depth Cropping with Deeplabv3+

This example shows how to run the [Deeplabv3+](https://zoo-rvc4.luxonis.com/luxonis/deeplab-v3-plus/1189a661-fd0a-44fd-bc9e-64b94d60cb49) model from our HubAI along with the [StereoDepth](https://rvc4.docs.luxonis.com/software/depthai-components/nodes/stereo_depth/) node and crop the depth image based on the models output.

> **Note:** This example requires a device with at least 3 cameras (color, left and right) since it utilizes the `StereoDepth` node.

## Demo

## Usage

Running this example requires a **Luxonis device** connected to your computer. Refer to the [documentation](https://stg.docs.luxonis.com/software-v3/) to setup your device if you haven't done it already.

You can run the example fully on device ([`STANDALONE` mode](#standalone-mode-rvc4-only)) or using your computer as host ([`PERIPHERAL` mode](#peripheral-mode)).

Here is a list of all available parameters:

```
-d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                    Optional name, DeviceID or IP of the camera to connect to. (default: None)
-fps FPS_LIMIT, --fps_limit FPS_LIMIT
                    FPS limit for the model runtime. (default: 10 for RVC2 and 25 for RVC4)
```

## Peripheral Mode

### Installation

You need to first prepare a **Python 3.10** environment with the following packages installed:

- [DepthAI](https://pypi.org/project/depthai/),
- [DepthAI Nodes](https://pypi.org/project/depthai-nodes/).

You can simply install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running in peripheral mode requires a host computer and there will be communication between device and host which could affect the overall speed of the app. Below are some examples of how to run the example.

### Examples

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This will run the example with the default device and camera input.

## Standalone Mode (RVC4 only)

Running the example in the standalone mode, app runs entirely on the device.
To run the example in this mode, first install the `oakctl` tool using the installation instructions [here](https://stg.docs.luxonis.com/software-v3/oak-apps/oakctl).

The app can then be run with:

```bash
oakctl connect <DEVICE_IP>
oakctl app run .
```

This will run the example with default argument values. If you want to change these values you need to edit the `oakapp.toml` file (refer [here](https://stg.docs.luxonis.com/software-v3/oak-apps/configuration/) for more information about this configuration file).
